# McInnes(2015): Lesk [17] introduces a measure that determines the relatedness
# between two concepts by counting the number of overlaps
# between their two definitions. An overlap is the longest sequence
# of one or more consecutive terms that occur in both definitions.
# When implementing this measure in WordNet, Banerjee and
# Pedersen [18] found that the definitions were short, and did not
# contain enough overlaps to distinguish between multiple concepts,
# therefore, they extended this measure by including the definitions
# of the related concepts
